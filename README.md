# Vanilla Javascript archives

Instead of creating a new Github repository everytime, I plan on saving most of my simple one-off vanilla javascript solutions for interviews under one repo.

## The Project Factory
A simple HTML page with Javascript that fetches a list of Pokemons from an external endpoint and displays them on the page. 

### Setup and Run
After cloning the repo locally, on the command line,
```
npm install
npm run test
```
Or you can just open index.html in the browser
